# Text-Editor

This program implements a text editor using Stack and Linked List data structures.

Each line of text is saved into a linked list node, which consists of a data portion holding the text and a pointer to the next node of the linked list, which is the next line of the text. The program makes use of Stack data structure to implement the Undo function.

## Features:
Open an existing file and parse every line to a linked list.

Save into a file

Insert text into line n (user given line number and text)

Delete line n (user given line number)

Move line n to line m (interchanging two user given lines)
